  I want to view all publications i have published in format of bibtex

--Output from show all bibtex--
  Scenario: show all bibtex                                              # BibtexGenerateFile.feature:6
    Given I am at the publications                                       # ConferenciaSteps.groovy:48
    When I select the export bibtex file option at the publications menu # BibtexGenerateFileSteps.groovy:5
    And I select Generate All BibTex option at the export bibtex page    # BibtexGenerateFileSteps.groovy:9
