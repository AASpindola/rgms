Feature: journal article
  As a member of a research group
  I want to add, remove and modify journal articles I have published
  so that I can generate web pages and reports containing these articles

--Output from remove existing article web--
  Scenario: remove existing article web                                                                                                                 # Article.feature:62

    When I select the "Periodico" option at the publications menu                                                                                       # ArticleSteps.groovy:51
    And I select to view "A theory of software product line refinement" in resulting list                                                               # ArticleSteps.groovy:118
    Then the details are showed, I select the option to remove, and the article is properly removed by the system                                       # ArticleSteps.groovy:171
