Feature: Book
  As a member of a research group
  I want to add, remove and modify books I have published
  so that I can generate web pages and reports containing these books

  Scenario: new book
    Given the system has no book entitled "SPL Development"
    When  I create the book "SPL Development" with file name "HSPLE.pdf"
    Then  the book "SPL Development" is properly stored by the system
