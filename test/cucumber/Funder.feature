Feature: Funder
  As an administrator of the RGMS system
  I want to add, remove and modify funders in the system

  //Scenario: new funder
  //  Given the system has no funder with code "12345"
  //  When I create a funder with code "12345"
  //  Then the funder with code "12345" is properly stored by the system
